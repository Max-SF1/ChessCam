Welcome to our README.md file, we're still kind of figuring things out as we go.

*In this repository we have:*

* a .gitignore file, for text we don't want git to compile if I understand correctly
* a dockerfile, which is the recipe for creating images
* a dockercompose, which I believe is similar to an exe but I haven't yet got too far
* and a README markdown file - we are in it :)

## Setup

We want to work in an environment that has both git, github, VSCode, and Docker.
To do that, we first create a github account, download a VScode git extension, download docker, and a
VScode extension for docker too.

- we select an isolated folder where a localized instance of our project takes place.
- Using ``ctrl+shift+p`` and then selecting the command ``Docker: Add Docker files to Workspace`` we get a few empty docker files.
- linking the github account by logging into vscode, creating a git commit for the workspace
- creating a new github repository and linking it to the local git repo.
- we push the project to the interwebs.

---

We use a hefty amount of ChatGPT as reference for the commands.
